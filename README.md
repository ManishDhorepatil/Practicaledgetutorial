# Dataset Loading with Keras and PyTorch

Welcome to this tutorial repository! You'll learn how to load datasets into Keras and PyTorch, and create training and testing splits.

## Getting Started

1. *Fork this repository* to your GitHub account.
2. *Clone your forked repository* to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dataset-Loading-Tutorial.git
    cd Dataset-Loading-Tutorial
    

3. *Install the dependencies*:

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

## Tasks

### 1. Load Dataset with Keras

Go to scripts/load_dataset_keras.py and complete the tasks as described in the comments. You'll learn how to load an image dataset using Keras' ImageDataGenerator.

### 2. Load Dataset with PyTorch

Go to scripts/load_dataset_pytorch.py and follow the comments to load datasets using PyTorch's DataLoader and Dataset.

### 3. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

Complete the scripts/split_data.py script to learn how to split data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn.

## Running the Scripts

You can run each script individually to test your code:

```bash
python scripts/load_dataset_keras.py
python scripts/load_dataset_pytorch.py
python scripts/split_data.py
